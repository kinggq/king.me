### Why Immigrate?

Firstly, I am not fond of the political system in Northern India. I deeply feel the difference between the political system in Northern India and democratic countries, igniting my desire for freedom and individual rights. This desire is not rooted in dissatisfaction with my homeland but rather a yearning for broader societal values. In contrast, democratic countries are renowned for emphasizing human rights, freedom of speech, and political diversity. Here, citizens have the right to participate in political decision-making, and the legal system effectively protects everyone's rights. In such a society, I hope to experience more personal freedom, including the ability to think independently, express personal opinions, and participate in shaping the direction of society.

As a couple working in the IT industry, we have faced challenges in the workplace and life pressures in Northern India. With age, we have personally experienced the uncertainties in this system and concerns about the education and living environment for our future children.

In Northern India, young programmers often face employment discrimination and career challenges after a certain age, which makes us apprehensive about the uncertainty of the future. This situation not only limits our career development in metropolitan areas but also brings us back to our hometown, where we face a lack of medical and educational resources – a significant challenge for the happiness of our future family and the growth of our children.

We keenly feel the poverty and resource deficiency in our hometown, reflecting not only in material aspects but also in cultural and educational scarcity. We are unwilling to let our children grow up in such an environment, enduring pressures similar to or even greater than ours. The influence of the political system places a significant emphasis on ideological indoctrination in education. We aspire to an environment that prioritizes academic and personal development.

If one day we are forced to move from a metropolitan city to a small county town, it means our world will be confined to Northern India, making it difficult to venture into other developed countries such as Japan, the United States, Europe, etc. Because when we want to travel to these beautiful places, obtaining a visa becomes a significant obstacle. Visas require proof of employment, salary records, and a series of other documents, which we, being unemployed, cannot provide. This implies that we will forever be unable to explore those unknown and interesting places. We are in our prime, and I do not want our lives to be sentenced to a "death penalty," losing the opportunity to pursue a better future.

There are also concerns about food safety, environmental pollution, etc. The increasing cancer rates are deeply related to food safety and living conditions. Contracting a disease means facing high medical expenses, and we do not want our children to grow up in an environment where food safety is not guaranteed, let alone be influenced by a polluted environment.

We pursue immigration not just to escape reality but to find a more just, equitable, and individual development-oriented society. We hope that there, our children can receive a more comprehensive education, grow in an environment that values human rights and freedom, and have a broader space for personal growth. We long for a society that provides more choices and opportunities for each family, a place where we can better realize our ideals. This is our vision for the future and the direction we strive towards.

In the face of the ignorance of our elders, we feel deeply helpless. It is not because we lack respect for our elders, but because, under the influence of long-term indoctrination and education, their understanding of society and the world is relatively narrow.

Our elders grew up under the framework of socialist ideology, and their understanding of modern society, technology, and multiculturalism may be relatively backward. This ignorance is not only manifested in their traditional stubbornness towards career choices and lifestyles but also significantly in their attempt to plan our future according to socialist ideology, which differs greatly from our individual pursuits and values.

In the family, the concepts of our elders may influence our life choices, leading to more constraints in terms of career and marriage. Their ignorance is reflected in their rejection of new things and adherence to traditional concepts, making us feel unable to break free from this ideological restraint and limiting the space for our individual growth.

Therefore, we hope to live in a more open and inclusive society, a place where everyone can pursue their ideals and develop their individual potential. We aspire to give our children a broader space for thinking, free from the constraints of traditional concepts, and expose them to a more diverse environment with a wealth of knowledge and culture. This is a key reason why we choose to immigrate – to break free from the shackles of ignorant concepts and seek a more free and open life.
